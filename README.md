# Project Bella
### Praise be to Allah

### How to use?

Simply run the application on two or more computers in a subnet and you'll figure out the rest.
The idea was to use multicasting as the NAT traversal approach. So if you have your routers configured
to pass multicast packets then you'll probably be able to see the computers beyond your subnet.
Although the application works fine but the source code needs a complete revision for code readibility and optimization.
